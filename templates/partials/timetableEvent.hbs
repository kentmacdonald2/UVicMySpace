{{! How the height of events is calculated
    -------------------------------------------------------

    - the length of an event is in minutes
    - the height of a cell is 16px with a border of 1px
    - each event has a 1px top and bottom margin

    Each hour is 32px (16px per half hour cell) so the naive height of an event
    is,

            h = (l/60) * (32px - 2px)
              = l * 30/60
              = l * 0.5 px

   where l is in minutes, and we remove two pixels from the height to account
   for the margin. To adjust for each cells 1px border we first need to
   calculate how many cells we cross (how many hours we have basically), we'll
   pretend there's 64 minutes in an hour to make math easier then multiply by
   2px for the borders,

            hours = l/64 * 2px
                  = l * 1/32
                  = l * 0.0625

   so the total height will be,

            h = l * (0.5 + 0.0625)
              = l * (0.5625)
