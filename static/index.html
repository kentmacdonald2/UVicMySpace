            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>
                To help guide our design process our team observed users in a controlled environment to collect
                qualitative data on how UVic students interact with the current UVic web services, in particular, MyPage
                and Student Services. After some brief background questions we asked the students to perform a number of
                common tasks using the UVic web services.

                    <h2>Our Personas and Scenarios</h2>
                    <p>We developed two personas to help guide our design. The two personas we chose were a junior
                        student, Daniel, who had just started at UVic and a senior student, Amy, who was in her third
                        year.</p>

                    <p>Amy is an artistic 23 year old girl from Fredricton, New Brunswick. After graduating from high school she spent a year travelling. She fell in love with the many stories of people she met. Inspired by this, Amy set out to capture her perspective and tell stories through film. </p>
